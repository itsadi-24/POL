# Protecting Your Computer from Ransomware

Ransomware attacks are on the rise, affecting individuals and businesses alike. This guide will help you protect your data and know what to do if you become a victim.

## What is Ransomware?

Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts your files and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) to restore access. It can spread through:

- **Phishing emails** with malicious attachments
- **Compromised websites**
- **Infected software downloads**
- **Network vulnerabilities**

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Paying the ransom doesn't guarantee you'll get your files back. Many victims who pay never receive decryption keys.

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Keep Everything Updated

Regular updates patch security vulnerabilities:

```
✅ Operating System updates
✅ Browser updates
✅ Software/application updates
✅ Firmware updates
```

**Enable automatic updates whenever possible.**

### 2. Backup Your Data

The **3-2-1 Backup Rule**:

| Copies | Storage Types           | Location           |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| 3      | Total copies of data    | -                  |
| 2      | Different storage media | Local + External   |
| 1      | Offsite/Cloud           | Different location |

**Backup tips:**

- Automate your backups
- Test restore procedures regularly
- Keep offline backups (air-gapped)

### 3. Use Strong Security Software

Essential security layers:

1. **Antivirus/Anti-malware**

   - Windows Defender (built-in, good enough for most)
   - Malwarebytes (excellent second opinion scanner)

2. **Firewall**

   - Keep Windows Firewall enabled
   - Consider hardware firewall for businesses

3. **Email filtering**
   - Block executable attachments
   - Scan incoming files

### 4. Practice Safe Email Habits

**Red flags in emails:**

- ❌ Unexpected attachments
- ❌ Urgent language ("Act now!", "Immediate action required")
- ❌ Misspelled sender addresses
- ❌ Generic greetings ("Dear Customer")
- ❌ Requests for sensitive information

**Safe practices:**

- ✅ Verify sender identity
- ✅ Hover over links before clicking
- ✅ When in doubt, contact the sender directly
- ✅ Never enable macros in unexpected documents

### 5. Limit User Privileges

- Don't use admin accounts for daily tasks
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Use separate accounts for sensitive work

### 6. Network Security

**For home users:**

- Use strong WiFi passwords (WPA3 if available)
- Change default router credentials
- Enable network encryption

**For businesses:**

- Segment your network
- Use VPN for remote access
- Implement Zero Trust architecture
